Have you ever reached a new milestone in some endeavor, and looked back at your old work and realized that all of it was awful? That's where I'm at right now. I suppose the good news is that I'm growing as a writer... I hope. The bad news is that all of the old stories I posted here need to go away; indeed they may be hurting me and not helping in my quest to be published, even some of the published stuff. 
<br><br>
What all of this means is that this website is now empty, and will stay that way for the forseeable future. I plan on writing novels (and perhaps a few short stories) under a pen name. So unless that strategy changes, I may not post anything here ever again. 
<br><br>
So why leave this site up? Because my strategy may change, in which case I'll use this existing platform to begin posting stories or news updates once more. 
<br><br>
In the meantime, if you've somehow found yourself here, or were the rare loyal reader: thank you for stopping by, and all the best.
