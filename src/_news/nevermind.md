Ok, nevermind. Forget this publishing world. It's outdated, moves at a glacial pace, and is full of arbitrary gatekeepers. #rantover. I'm going to continue to publish my work here, and do as I please. I have quite a few works in the backlog to get out there, and will begin publishing my poems as well. So, look forward to lots more content in the days and weeks to come!

Sincerely, <br>
