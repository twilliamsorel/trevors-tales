      <h2 class="margin-bottom-200">About My Writing</h2>
      <p>
        In the past year or so, I've been focusing on short, literary fiction, mostly. However, just for your information, I'm planning on transitioning to writing more genre fiction, particularly fantasy and science fiction; genres where I can use my creativity to explore symbolism and myth more effectively.

      <h2 class="margin-top-600 margin-bottom-200">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Trevor Michaelson</strong> is a writer, musician, and software developer from the Bay Area. 
      </p>
      <p class="margin-top-400">
        He is currently painfully aware that he is writing about himself in third person, and feels quite uncomfortable about the whole ordeal; Trevor has never been much of a salesperson and, like any decent creative, is highly self critical. He questions how much about him is really worth knowing, and questions you for wanting to know about him in the first place... but you should keep reading his stuff... and sharing it. He likes it when you do those things.
      </p>
      <p class="margin-top-400">
        If you're interested in listening to some of his music, you can find that by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/poems-and-coffee" target="blank">clicking here</a> ... and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/urban_attic" target="blank">here</a>, though, he asks that you don't base your interest in his writing on your interest in his music. Why would you, you ask? Because you're a dirty heuristic thinker, like every other stinking bipedal ape on this planet, and were about to do just that.

        Have a wonderful day.
