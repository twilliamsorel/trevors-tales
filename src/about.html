        <strong>Trevor Sorel</strong> is a writer, musician, and software developer from the Bay Area. 
      </p>
      <p class="margin-top-400">
        Currently, he is painfully aware that he is writing about himself in third person, and feels quite uncomfortable about the whole ordeal; Trevor has never been much of a salesperson and, like any decent creative, is highly self critical. He questions how much about him is really worth knowing, and questions you for wanting to know about him in the first place... but you should keep reading his stuff... and sharing it. He likes it when you do those things.
      </p>
      <p class="margin-top-400">
        If you're interested in listening to his music, you can find that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/urban_attic" target="blank">here</a>, though, he asks that you don't judge your interest in his writing based on your interest in his music. Why would you, you ask? Because you're a dirty heuristic thinker, like every other stinking bipedal ape on this planet, and were about to do just that.
      </p>

        Have a wonderful day.
