The Colony of the Morning Star sat at the bottom of a large basin, carved from a deep deposit of sedimentary rock, so that the edges of the colony were ringed by tall cliffs of sandstone. The tall slopes sparkled in the midday suns, refracting the daylight in vibrant orange hues. Along the eastern border of this small valley sat the derelict starship, which rose over the settlement like a fallen titan. The forward hull of the vessel protruded from the desert sand at an angle, exposing the bold letters on the bow, which read: The Redemption. Beneath this leviathan, the structures of the colony appeared as miniatures. They were but a collection of shiny dots, made luminous by their reflective metal roofs.

Twenty nine followed Forty Seven away from the starship, down a steep slope of golden sand and rust red stone. He chose his footing carefully, a tentative arm gripping at Forty Seven’s shoulder for support as his weak legs probed the ground with each step. Thirty Five took up the rear, arms crossed as he navigated the terrain with ease.

“You can see the buildings from here, at the bottom of the valley,” said Forty Seven, pointing to the structures in the near distance. “The ship created the depression when it crashed.”

Twenty Nine nodded, staring at the vast desert that surrounded the colony on all sides. “But where do you find water?”

“Ah, yes. Good question,” said Forty Seven. “Your brain is already coming into form. Don’t forget everything, see? You remember the desert, and that you must drink.”

“Simple things,” said Thirty Five. He squinted at the sun in irritation before pulling a white linen hood over his head to shade his pale features. “Semantic things. Do you remember other deserts from your past? Have memories of such a place?”

Twenty Nine furrowed his brow. “No. I don’t remember.”

“Ignore him,” said Forty Seven, batting his hand. “You’re doing well. Memories are only a burden, anyhow. They rob the present moment of all its pleasures, and leave nothing for surprise.”

“Perhaps,” said Thirty Five, smirking from under his hood. “Perhaps you truly believe that, at least.”

Forty Seven’s face darkened as he cast Thirty Five a warning glance. The look lasted only a few moments, but it’s venom cut deep, and Thirty Five fell into silence as he averted his gaze.

“You asked about the water?” said Forty Seven, returning to Twenty Nine. “We use machines from the ship. Zero showed us how. What were they called, Thirty Five?”

Thirty Five swallowed, his adam's apple bobbing in the daylight. “Moisture condensers,” he said.

“Moisture condensers, that’s right. See those over there?” In the middle of the colony stood, what appeared to be, three large vents, each attached to a large cistern. “They collect the water in the air and store them in those tanks. So we have an endless supply.”

“But water is still scarce,” said Thirty Five, a slight quiver detectable in his voice. “The condensers take time to do their work. We must be careful with our usage, or we won’t have enough.”

“It’s true,” said Forty Seven. “Bathing is a challenge. Though we have enough to drink, and irrigate the crops.”

“The water is carefully rationed,” said Thirty Five. “We’re each allotted a daily allowance of five liters. No more, no less.”

“So don’t spill,” said Forty Seven.

Twenty Nine tightened his lips in worry as he stared at the condensers, which were growing larger as the trio grew closer to the settlement.

“Ah, look!” said Forty Seven. “We near the colony, my friend.”

Twenty Nine returned his gaze to the foreground, where dozens of people had gathered in a semi circle around the edge of the village. Like his companions, everyone who had gathered was bald.

Struck by curiosity, Twenty Nine reached for his scalp and ran a hand over the crown of his head, where his fingers were greeted by a healthy mop of hair. He grunted in confusion at the discovery.

“You’re all bald,” he said, a hint of distress audible in his voice.

“We are. You’ll learn about that soon,” said Forty Seven, patting him on the back. “Let’s meet the others.”

Forty Seven led the trio toward the semi circle, raising his arms to speak. “Friends, a brother has woken!” he said, gesturing toward Twenty Nine. “Join me in welcoming him home.”

The colonists, all dressed in the same linen tunics and cargo pants, started clapping. “What’s his number!” shouted one among them.

“He is Twenty Nine,” said Forty Seven.

“He is Twenty Nine!” The colony spoke in unison.

“Step forward, Twenty Nine. Show yourself to your new family.” Forty Seven moved aside, making way for the newcomer to address the audience.

Twenty Nine came forward on his already unsteady legs, made weaker by nervous adrenaline. He stood before this crowd of onlookers, now upward of fifty people, and was suddenly aware that he was naked. It was a thought that had never crossed his mind as noteworthy until that moment. He blushed and stared at his feet, covering his genitals with his hands.

“Twenty Nine,” said the crowd, in unison once more.

He nodded in response, tightening his lips as he bobbed his head.

“Who will guide him?” said Forty Seven, his voice booming toward the crowd. There was a theatrical tone to it, one that triggered a word in Twenty Nine’s mind: ritual. There was a long pause.

“I will guide him,” A dark featured woman stepped forward on long legs, her stern face raised and unreadable. 

“And what is your number?” said Forty Seven.

“I am Fourteen,” said the woman. 

“You will instruct him to live in balance?”

“I will instruct him to live.”

“You will teach him to walk in the light?”

“I will teach him to walk.”

“And You will show him the path to zero?”

“I will show him the path.”

“Very well,” said Forty Seven, clapping his hands together. “It is done. Walk in the light, Fourteen. Walk in the light, Twenty Nine.”

Fourteen reached out and took Twenty Nine’s hand as the audience began to clap once more. It was a half hearted celebration, flavored with a hint of duty that left the occasion feeling stiff and uncomfortable. Soon the applause died down and people dispersed, a few clasping Twenty Nine on the shoulder in welcome as they filtered back into the settlement. It was over as quickly as it began, and within a few moments, only Forty Seven, Thirty Five, and Fourteen remained.

“It is our tradition to have another colonist teach you our ways, upon waking,” said Forty Seven. “A necessity, with our missing memories.”

Twenty Nine nodded, eyeing Fourteen from the corner of his vision like a nervous dog.

“But should you need anything…” said Forty Seven, letting his words trail off.

“I’ll let you know.”

“Already finishing sentences.” Forty Seven flashed a cryptic smile. “See Thirty Five, he’s sharp as a tack.”

“Indeed,” said Thirty Five, his stare intent upon the newcomer’s face.

“We’re a small community, newborn, so I’ll be seeing you.” Forty Seven started towards the village. “Walk in the light!”

Thirty Five nodded, a smirk visible on his face. “Walk in the light, Twenty Nine.” He let the words hang for a moment before he gave a curt bow. “Fourteen,” He said in acknowledgement, and then stalked off. 

“Come along, then,” said Fourteen, beckoning for Twenty Nine to follow as she led him toward the village. “You’ll be expected to pull your weight, and there’s much to do.”
