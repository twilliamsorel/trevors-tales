That evening, Twenty Nine returned to Fourteen’s tent, his neck reddened by sun burn and shoulders slumped from exhaustion. His mentor was sitting on her bed, whittling at a meat plant with a knife as she watched him. She sliced the strange vegetable into thin pieces, popping each strip into her mouth one at a time. Twenty Nine greeted her with a curt nod before plopping himself onto his cot and closing his eyes. There was an uncomfortable silence, the sort that crept under the skin and traveled up the spine, begging to be broken. Twenty Nine shifted in his cot, turning to face the wall; he held fast to the silence, resolving to sit in it until the discomfort faded.

“Forty Seven tells me you witnessed mass,” said Fourteen, piercing the room with her words.

Twenty Nine cringed. “Yeah, a bit of it.”

“And? What did you think?” Fourteen spat a seed out onto the floor.

“Up is down and down is up.”

Fourteen nodded. “It’s disorienting, waking up. But things get better, newborn.”

Twenty Nine remained silent in his cot.

Fourteen finished her meat plant and threw the husk into a small waste bin by the drop cloth. “Let me know how if can help.”

There was a long pause before Twenty Nine spoke. “I don’t know who to trust,” he said.

Fourteen nodded, letting out a drawn out hum in agreement. “I’d say you can trust me, but that won’t do much good, will it?”

Twenty Nine smiled in the dark. “No, I guess not.”

“I’ll just have to show you, then,” said Fourteen, pulling her covers over her shoulders. “Sleep well, newborn.”

“Sleep well.”

“Wake up, newborn.” Fourteen stood over Twenty Nine’s cot, shaking him with a calloused palm. “It’s morning. Time to move.” She watched him stir from his sleep as she looped tools into her belt. 

Twenty Nine squinted, staring about the tent as though expecting a surprise. Sleep had not come easily that night, and his body felt cold and heavy. “Already? It’s barely bright out!”

“The best time for field work. Less heat means less water wasted.” She touched the cherry-red sunburn on the back of Twenty Nine’s neck, clicking her tongue. “And we won’t burn to a crisp.”

Twenty Nine moaned, rolling out of bed. “Field work again?”

“Is there anything else?”

“Apparently not.” He pulled his tunic down over his head. “It’s all field work and ominous rituals with this place.”

“Hard labor will get your mind off things,” said Fourteen, already with one foot outside. “And if you behave yourself, we’ll go for a treat after.”

Twenty Nine smirked as his mind recollected ancient concepts from his semantic memory. “You’re acting like my…” He paused mid-sentence. Paternalism, motherliness—the ideas bounced around his head in a sudden rush of electrical pulses, and he was struck by a wave of emotion. The world spun and his legs buckled; he barely caught his fall with an outstretched hand.

“You alright, newborn?” Fourteen pulled him to his feet. “What’s wrong?”

Twenty Nine stared at his companion, his brow furrowed. “I… I can’t remember my mother,” he said tears welling up in his eyes.

Fourteen gave a solemn nod. “Why would you? None of us can.”

“It doesn’t bother you?”

Fourteen shrugged her rounded shoulders. “It did, at first. But why dwell on what I can’t change?”

Twenty Nine gripped his head. “I don’t even know what’s been taken from me.”

“Exactly, so don’t stress.” She beckoned for him to follow. “We better get to work. You’re thinking too much.”

Twenty Nine followed Fourteen through the sleepy village, guided only by the faint glow of the dawn sky—it was colored a metallic cobalt in the early light, streaked with the polished lines of hazy clouds. They soon reached the fields, the landscape calm and unperturbed by the vagaries of daylight. The air was still and silent, so that each breath came to the forefront of Twenty Nine’s attention.

“See, it’s nice, isn’t it?” said Fourteen, gesturing at their surroundings. “Much better than a late rise.”

“Yeah.”

Fourteen turned to take stock of her charge. He dragged his feet in the dirt, his eyes planted on the ground, staring at unseen shadows.

“You rake?” she said, handing him the tool.

“Yeah, sure,” he said, but only stood there, not moving to take the implement. His gaze was distant and unresponsive.

Fourteen shook her head, and exhaled sharply. “Then take the tool, Twenty Nine!” she said, tapping his arm with the handle. “Wake up!”

“Sorry.” He took it, and followed behind his mentor, dragging the metal prongs of the rake into the ground half-heartedly.

The morning went by slowly, as the pair moved through the rows at a crawling pace. They were only halfway done when the noontime suns shone hot on their backs.

“Twenty Nine,” said Fourteen, dropping her sack of lizard guano to the earth in tired exasperation. “Why don’t we take a break? Freshen up a bit before tackling the last rows.”

“Suits me,” he said, throwing his rake to the ground.

Fourteen crouched down and observed the plants underfoot with a careful eye. After a moment, she grunted and uprooted a large meat plant rich in color. The then untied an empty cloth sack from her utility belt and threw it inside. “To the market. We’ll get that treat I spoke of,” she said, leading the way with long strides. Twenty Nine followed, breaking from his dragging pace to keep up.

The market consisted of a small ring of stalls placed near the center of the colony. Unlike the other buildings in the village, these were constructed of timber boards. The material was so long exposed to desert heat and erosion that it bore a resemblance to driftwood, with smooth and faded edges. Colonists mingled about these rickety structures, their white tunics and bald heads gleaming in the sun as they bartered.

Fourteen led Twenty Nine to a stall that sat on the north eastern edge of the circle, from which a young man was trading glass jars filled with a cloudy cardinal-red fluid.

“Tee Three.” Fourteen addressed the young man, removing the meat plant from the pouch at her waist. “How many jars will this get me?”

Two Thirty Three cast an assessing eye over his customers, his gaze settling on Twenty Nine. There was a slight pucker to his face as he spoke. “Newborn trying out the juice, huh?” He took the meat plant from Fourteen and examined it, making a show of sucking on his teeth. “Yeah, alright,” he said. “That’s enough for two I guess.” He reached underneath the stall and produced two jars of the milky red fluid.

Fourteen opened the jars and handed one to Twenty Nine. She then raised hers in a toast before finishing the drink in a few eager gulps. Twenty looked on in mild fascination, hesitating to put the container to his lips.

“Know what that stuff is, Newbo?” said Tee Three, looking on from behind the stall. “We call it moon juice. Takes the edge off.”

“Try it, newborn. It will help you relax,” said Fourteen. 

“I don’t know.” Twenty Nine stared at the milky red fluid with a puckered brow. “What’s it made of?”

“Do we tell em?” A playful smile occupied Tee Three’s face.

Fourteen shrugged; her posture seemed to be relaxing, her eyelids coming down over her eyes. “It’s harmless,” she said.

“I don’t know.” He stared at the milky red fluid, an alien fluid; it was unfamiliar and foreboding. 

“Listen, newborn,” said Fourteen, an edge creeping into her voice, despite her sedation. “Your nerves are frayed from stress. This will sooth them for a time. Think of it as medicine.”

Twenty Nine set the jar back on the stall counter and shook his head. “I won’t.”

“Suit yourself.” Fourteen returned her jar to Tee Three, and turned away. “I tried. Do what you like with the juice, newborn.” She then sauntered off to barter at another stall.

Twenty Nine stared at his toes in shame, a feeling of helplessness and abandonment rising from a pit in his stomach. Even in the desert heat, his face was pale and colorless.

“It’s lizard venom,” said Tee Three, with a grin. “That’s what it’s made from.”

Twenty Nine stared at Two Thirty Three blankly—the young man’s playful expression was lost on him. There could be no joy in this world, no feeling beyond dread and panic. He turned away from the stall and walked off, leaving the vendor to a perplexed frown.
He spotted a bench a few yards away and sat down, letting out a sigh before burying his face in his palms, rubbing furiously. The world seemed out of focus and distant—like an invisible blanket had been thrown over his reality; his vision seemed to vibrate, clouded by translucent floaters, hands drifted through the air as though they were lost. He dared not think, for every thought seemed to cascade into a bottomless pit of despair—heart palpitations, sweaty palms, vertigo. But thoughts came, banged at the doors of his consciousness like unwelcome guests.

Twenty Nine did his best to hold back tears.

Fourteen watched Twenty Nine from across the way, her brow set in worry. He sat on a bench, shaking his leg as he ceaselessly fidgeted with his hair; his sunken eyes were encased by dark circles, and they darted about like unsettled gnats.

“Trouble with your charge?” A familiar voice spoke from behind. 

She turned to find Eighty Nine beside her, his sinewy arms clasped behind his back in his usual alert posture. She gave a short nod. “I’m worried for him.”

“He doesn’t look well,” said Eighty Nine, humming in agreement. “But he’s not the first to catch the sickness of wakening. We all experienced it, to some degree.”

“It seems worse, for him—like he’s unraveling.”

“It’s been bad for others as well. It’s what the path is for,” said Eighty Nine; despite his words, he watched the newborn with a look of paternal concern.

“Maybe so.”

The water custodian patted her shoulder, his eyes softening. “There’s nothing you can do but set him on the path, now.”

Fourteen nodded. “I’ll speak with Forty Seven.”

“Best do it soon,” he said. “It’s a shame to watch him suffer.”
