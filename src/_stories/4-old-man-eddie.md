“Well, I’m afraid, I guess.” said Eddie. He had tucked his hands under his legs as he spoke, and leaned forward slightly, beaming an innocent smile from under a bushy white mustache.

“And why are you afraid?” said the doctor, awaiting Eddie’s answer with a practiced patience.

“Oh…” said Eddie, looking down and wrinkling his brow. He thought slowly and carefully, as though it took all his effort, but he never lost that euphoric smile. He looked back up, and his face contorted with a flash of fear. “I’m just gettin’ old, I guess.” He spoke louder than was necessary, his big ears taking in less sound than they used to. His dopey smile had already returned as he looked at the doctor hopefully.

“And, Eddie, why does that scare you?” asked the doctor. An edge of impatience creeping into his voice — an edge he quickly smoothed over.

“Well, I dunno. My friends started dying, and I guess I realized I’m gettin’ old…” said Eddie, contorting his face as that flash of anxiety washed over him again. “It got me worrying, I guess.” He said, and returned to smiling, smiling as though he had just tasted ice cream for the first time.

“Perhaps, Eddie, you are reaching that stage in life that we all reach?” said the doctor, strained and impatient. “That point where we have to face our mortality. We all die; it’s something we have to come to terms with.”

“Yeah…” said Eddie, oblivious to the doctor’s tone. “But what if I’m not ready, doc?” Eddie hunched over more as he spoke, his faded old blue jeans crumpling under the grip of his withered hands. He had got those jeans in 1982, and worn them whenever he gardened, usually on Sundays, for thirty six years.

“Death doesn’t care if we are ready or not, Eddie.” said the doctor. “We must prepare ourselves.”

“But how do I do that?” Eddie managed to express a hint of exasperation in his slow, loud voice.

“Do you have a religion?” said the doctor.

“Well… I was raised protestant, but I haven’t practiced in years.” said Eddie, shaking his head in confusion.

“And do you believe in god?”

“Well, gee, I don’t know. I hope something’s after this!” said Eddie, smiling hopefully at the doctor. “But I don’t know…”

“Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you, Eddie. But maybe you should talk to someone else about this; a friend, maybe? A preacher?” The doctor gave Eddie’s shoulder a quick pat.

“Oh, okay, doc…” said Eddie, his smile pulled down slightly, as he sat, befuddled, upon the examination chair.

“Have a good day, Eddie.” Said the doctor as he briskly stepped out of the room.

“But… doc?” said Eddie, hesitantly calling after him. But it was too late; the doctor had already left the room.

Eddie shook his head, puzzled, and let his eyes wander out the window. It was a warm and sunny day outside, like those ancient summers from long ago; the carefree summers of childhood. For a moment, he could almost hear his older brother urging him to play outside in that booming voice that was so commanding — even as a young boy. “Come along, Ed.” He’d always say, dragging Eddie by the arm. “Let’s go hit some home runs.”

Eddie smiled to himself at the thought. He longed to play baseball again, to see his brother’s face swell with pride when his bat would connect with the ball… but he was old now, and they were all gone.

There would be no more approving looks from his older brother; no more loving glances of exasperation from his late wife; no more happy licks from his old dog.

“But everybody’s gone, doc.” he whispered to himself, his smile finally vanquished. “Everybody’s gone…”
