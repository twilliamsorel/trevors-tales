The next morning Twenty Nine woke to daylight pouring through the thin canvas walls of his tent, with Fourteen nowhere to be found. So he sat at the edge of his bed and awaited her return, his cheek freshly lined by the wrinkles of his pillow, shoulders hunched in petulant frustration. But time passed slowly, haunted by an odd silence that pervaded from the outside—the usual sounds of murmuring colonists and shuffling feet conspicuously absent. Moreover, the heat of the desert suns brought the tent to an uncomfortable temperature, and a sweaty Twenty Nine was soon picking at the canvas rope that bound his cot as he sucked on his teeth.

“Well.” he said to himself as he stood and stretched. “I’ll just have to go find her, then.” 

Outside Fourteen’s tent, the pathways of packed dirt that wound between the canvas homes were usually well traveled. Even in the odd hours, Twenty Nine had seen clusters of smiling faces gathering about the tents, had heard rustling in neighbors abodes as they went about their business. But as the newborn stepped out, there was only silence, and not a face to be found.

He peered into tents as he moved through the colony, his pace quickening as an uneasiness rose inside of him. With each empty tent he came upon, his breath came harder, his eyes darting more wildly. 

“Come on. Come on.” He said between pants. “There has to be someone.”

Then, he heard a noise—a deep grumble rising up from the ground, as though the earth itself was singing; humming a monastic chant with a throat of stone. He followed the sound, felt it through his feet, and soon came upon a large tent that he had never noticed before, positioned in the center of the settlement. The flap that covered it’s entrance was pulled to the side and tied in place with a piece of twine. From inside, the sound of the rumbling earth radiated with greater intensity.

Twenty Nine took a deep breath, and stepped inside to find an empty room with a large pit at its center, from which the noise seemed to emanate. He approached hole on worried toes, peeking over the edge as though peering out of a fox hole. Inside was a staircase carved out of hard packed earth, leading underground. The tunnel’s inky darnkess was displaced only by a faint red glow that emanated from deeper down. Within, the chanting roared like a crackling fire—a shadowy furnace of the unknown.

The newborn’s heartbeat pounded in his ears and strangled his lungs with adrenaline. He stared back outside, toward the empty settlement behind him. The wind had picked up and whipped at the flaps of the tent like an angry ghost; breathed warm eddies that sent grains of sand tumbling over the ground. It bore a message of finality—the terror of abandonment on an alien world.

He stood frozen for a moment, caught between nightmares. But he had to move. Motion was all there was.

He took a step down the staircase, as quietly as he could manage, and then he took another. With each step, the noises from below grew louder—a deep rumble of voices, echoing off the walls of the cave below, mixing with the shadows cast by torchlight that danced across his face. The stone beneath his feet, the flames protruding from the walls, smoke that tickled his nostrils, all seemed to vibrate with the same frequency, all blended into his senses until they seemed indistinguishable.

Then, he came upon the end of the staircase, an archway opening into a large cavern beneath the earth, lined with torches that painted the walls and ceiling black with smoky residue. Here he found the colonists, sitting cross-legged in rows and rows, filling the space. They were all oriented toward the far side of the room, where Forty Seven sat on a large cushion. The Voice of Zero’s mouth was agape, but moved slightly as he led their chant, which poured forth from every mouth in the room like a fleshy pipe organ.

Twenty Nine stared at the scene in awe, entranced by the vibrating tones; paralyzed by the spectacle before him. To his eyes, the uniform crowd blended—bald heads and linen tunics merging into a mass of indistinguishable bodies; a thousand limbs that dangled from a single torso. As he watched, the chanting waves of sound began to wash over him, splashing against his consciousness with waves of mounting pressure.

Suddenly, Forty Seven’s eyelids fluttered open and fell upon the newcomer as his mouth twitched into a smile. The eye contact sent shivers of lightning down Twenty Nine’s spine; repulsed him, overwhelmed him. Suddenly he was a spider in a colony of carpenter ants; a dog in a den of wolves. 

He turned and ran back up the stairs, ran out of the big tent and away from the center of the village, and kept running. He ran until the curves of the Morning Star Basin rose into steep ridges, and the colony was only a speck behind him. Only then did the adrenaline begin to fade.

He came to a stop on the edge of the basin, a raised plateau above the colony below. From here, he could view the sweeping desert in it’s entirety, the horizon line unobscured by ridges and protruding cliff edges. Exhausted and out of breath, he plopped his sweaty form upon the ground with an exasperated breath.

From his perch, he could see the bright suns cast sparkling light over the endless golden dunes before him. It was a beautiful sight, and Twenty Nine found himself relaxing as his mind wandered. It drifted out, fluttering over the dunes like a desert bird seeking escape from the sands below. He sat this way for some time and tried to make sense of what he saw, barely noticing the sound of footsteps approaching from behind.

“And who is this?” said a familiar voice. “A solitary man, with only rocks for company, looking pensive.”

Twenty Nine spun around to find Thirty Five standing behind him, his signature hood pulled over his head to shield him from the late morning light.

“Rather strange behavior for a colonist.” said Thirty Five as he crouched down next to the newborn. “One has to wonder—what could he be reflecting on, with only a day's worth of memories to call his own?”

“Why aren’t you with the others, in that cave?” said Twenty Nine, squinting at the intruder.

Thirty Five smirked. “So you stumbled upon their little ritual, did you? We call it mass. I don’t go because I have no desire to.”

“Their ritual? You aren’t one of them?”

“Aren’t you?”

“Not sure.” said Twenty Nine, returning his gaze to the colony below.

“Nor am I.” Thirty Five tapped his chin with a long finger. “Tell me—what did you think of mass?”

Twenty Nine shrugged. “Don’t know what I saw. I only stayed for a few moments before I left.”

“I saw you down in the settlement. You were running.”

“I was overwhelmed, I guess.”

“An interesting reaction, for a newborn.” said Thirty Five. “To run, and to reflect.”

“Maybe reflecting is in my nature,” said Twenty Nine.

Thirty Five raised a thin black eyebrow. “Perhaps.” He kicked his feet out over the ridge and sat himself on the hard earth.

“Though nature rarely asserts itself here. Most newborns are a blank slate—they mould to the status quo like putty in a press.”

Twenty Nine snorted. “I’d be happy to mould, if someone explained the damned rules.”

“You might try sulking less, for starters, especially in the hills. Never leaves a good impression.”

“You’re here, aren’t you?”

“I’m at peace with my nature, unlike you.” Thirty Five waved an arm over the valley below. “I’ve found my place here.”

“And what’s that?”

“I’m a mechanic. I keep the moisture condensers running, among other things.”

“That’s your nature—to be a mechanic?”

“It suits me well. I’m allowed to be different, because I must be.” He cast a sidelong glance. “It grants me access to knowledge… access to Zero.”

At this, Twenty Nine spun his head, locking eyes with the hooded man. “You know Zero?”

Thirty Five nodded, causing his hood to bob over his features like a reluctant shadow. “It’s a begrudging relationship, really; built on necessity. He tells me what I need to know, and little else.”

Twenty Nine let out a disappointed sigh, and returned his gaze to the settlement below.

“Though, I learn more than he thinks—peering through cracks in conversation, catching half truths where they don’t add up.” continued Thirty Five.

“Yeah, like what?” Twenty Nine watched the hooded figure from the corner of his eye.

“Perhaps I’ll share something I’ve learned, in time—when I have a better grasp on who you are.”

“And why should I trust you? Maybe you’re just paranoid.”

Thirty Five stood and dusted off his trousers. “Maybe you shouldn’t. Though I’m not the one who demands blind obedience.” He tapped his temple. “Watch for yourself. Think for yourself. See if it all adds up.”

Twenty Nine stared out over the horizon with searching eyes, a pained expression on his face. He remained quiet.

“Enjoy your solitude.” said Thirty Five, and with a short bow turned to go.

“Wait.” said Twenty Nine. “Tell me about more about this mass.”

“Not my specialty. Ask your mentor.”

“Another question then.”

Thirty Five nodded in assent.

“A guy I met in the colony got real upset at me for drawing circles in the sand. Started screaming about taboos.”

“Ah yes, art. It’s Forbidden.”

“Art? It was barely a scribble.”

“Even so.”

“But why? That makes no sense.” said Twenty Nine.

“It’s an act of individual expression. It threatens the collective.”

“How? It’s just—”

Thirty Five spoke over the newborn, cutting him off. “You’ll have to ask Forty Seven about mass and taboo.” he nearly spit as he uttered the word. “He may enlighten you. I don’t fully understand it myself.”

Twenty Nine nodded. “I just might.”

Thirty Five turned away once more. “Walk in the light, newborn.” He said, his voice dripping with irony. With that, he descended the ridge, leaving Twenty Nine alone once more.

Twenty Nine stared at the sky, hoping to find refuge in the universal image of clouds and sunshine; seeking an anchor of familiarity to ground his fledgling identity. But all he found above him were two suns—blinding specks of alien light in a tight concentric orbit. The sky was no refuge; there was no anchor, and a panic rose in him like a fire over dry leaves. The sand that surrounded him was suddenly an ocean of chaos. It churned and crashed in infinite loops and eddies which he feared he would never understand.

His palms grew clammy and his vision blurred; his pulse echoed in his ears and a feeling of terror crept up from his brainstem, saturating his thoughts with acid. He sat this way for what felt like an eternity, until finally the moment passed.
