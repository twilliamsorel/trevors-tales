“Have you ever played one of those ‘either, or’ games?” I asked William, as he wrestled an oversized sandwich into his mouth.

“Yeah, sure. Why?” he said, absent-mindedly wiping mayonnaise from the corner of his mouth with a crumpled napkin.

“I’ve been thinking of one; I’d be curious to hear your answer to it.” I said, pushing lettuce around on my plate, tired of eating the bitter leaves.

“Ok, shoot.” he said.

“Alright, ” I said, perking up. “Let me think of how to present this… Ok, I’m going to give a description of two people, and you tell me which you’d rather be.”

“Right, I thought that was how this worked.” said Will.

“I mean this one will be a bit more involved…” I paused mid explanation, waving a hand at him. “Just shut up and listen.”

I continued. “You are a luminary, recognized by all for your brilliance — a man of legendary intellect and ability. Crowds gather in awe when you go out in public; people quiver nervously when you address them directly. You will go down in history: a DaVinci, a Newton, an Einstein.”

“This is sounding pretty good so far.” said Will, taking another bite of his sandwich.

“Just wait.” I said. “You are wealthy and privileged, as your societal contributions have brought you a fortune through patents, or sales, or whatever — it depends on the amazing thing you did — and you live a lifestyle in accordance with that. You own a chateau along the French riviera, if you so choose; you have servants; you only travel in hotels with a minimum of four stars… you get the picture.”

“Yeah. It’s still sounding pretty good.” said will.

“BUT,” I said, raising my finger for emphasis. “As a misunderstood genius, you abhor the company of others. They are just too slow, too uninformed, too pedestrian. And your ego has only grown with your station and successes, fueled by a quiet bitterness at your self-imposed isolation. You long for the company of an equal, true companionship that doesn’t leave you feeling bored and dull — but it never comes.”

“Huh,” said Will, staring into the distance as he assembled a picture of his fictional genius-self.

“You spend nights indulging in quiet luxury: smoking cigars on empty balconies, overlooking beautiful views that you will never share. Float in heated pools, on rafts that no one else will touch. Everything is an empty void. And you die that way, alone but remembered.”

“Geez. Quite a game, isn’t it.” said Will. “Is that all for this character?”

“Yeah, that’s all.” I said.

“So what’s the next one?”

“This one’s simple, really. You would find the love of your life, the most beautiful specimen of whatever gender you’re attracted to.” I continued.

“Uh, women, please. You know that.” said Will, nodding to the waitress as he handed her the check.

“Right right, minor details.” I say, waving my hand dismissively. “You are happily married to this dream woman. You live a conventional life with her, are healthy, raise a family, and die surrounded by your loved ones.”

“There isn’t much detail to this one. It doesn’t seem fair.”

“Well, this is a cultural archetype — you already know how it goes. The other one’s a bit less common, so I had to evoke more.”

Will snorted. “Ha, fair ‘nuff!”.

“But I’m not done.” I said. “The tradeoff is that you die as you were born, a nobody; another brick in the wall. AND your children don’t take your name. There is no evidence that you ever existed, besides a few digital photos in an Instagram account that no one will ever look at.”

“Hey! What about my family, they remember me, don’t they?” Will threw out his hands. “And I thought this was a happy marriage! Why don’t my kids have my last name? My hypothetical dream girl is turning out to be sort of a bitch… it doesn’t make sense.”

“Of course your family remembers you, but you know how it is. A few generations go by and you’re just some guy to them. Do you know your great-great-grandpa’s name?”

“Fair point. But what about the last name? I know my last name is his last name!”

“Easy: you only have girls. They all take their husbands’ names upon marriage.” I said.

“Well, shit. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.” said Will.

“So, which is it?” I already knew the answer coming, based on the sly smile creeping across his face.

“How about both?” he said, raising his eyebrows playfully.

“Be serious; of course you can’t have both — we all want both.”

“Alright…” he said, pausing and staring into space for a moment. “I’d pick the latter. The wife and kids ‘n such. How bout you?”

“Same.” I said.

“Funny, I pinned you for the number-one-guy, for sure.” said Will, with a sly smile.

“Yeah, well I’m shooting for both, but I’d rather have the latter.” I put my hands behind my head and leaned back. “I’ve got this theory that people who accomplish so much are usually doing so in order to have an easier time of getting laid anyhow.”

“Right right.” said Will. “Was it …Marx?”

“Ha! You’re thinking of Freud, a different misguided German intellectual — they had a lot of those, when you think about it.”

“Oh,” said Will, blushing as he slapped his forehead. “Right.”

“Anyway, it’d be number two for me, if I could find it. It seems harder and harder these days; like the more technological society gets, the more impersonal and repressed it becomes, and the more aspirants to greatness it spawns. Aspirants, all seeking fortune and glory to compensate for woefully inadequate personal lives.”

“You, sir, are in a particularly cheery mood today.” said Will, raising his mostly finished pint of IPA. With a flourish, he shot the remainder down his open mouth, wiped his beard with his crumpled napkin, and stood. “Pretty ladies for both of us, then. Where shall we seek them?”

“I’ll be seeking my pretty ladies as far away from you as possible.” I said, joining him as we walked out of the restaurant. “you’d only slow me down.”

Will cackled in a fit of overzealous laughter, more than the situation merited. But I knew that the lions share of that giggle belonged to brotherly love, and not to my humor.
