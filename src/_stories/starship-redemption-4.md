The work in the fields took hours, and by the time Twenty Nine and Fourteen had finished, they were drenched in sweat, and the suns were hovering low over the horizon. The discomfort from their earlier conversation had worn away with labor, and as the pair headed back toward the settlement, they were easy in each other's company once more.

Twenty Nine cantered along beside his companion, drinking from his water jug with eager gulps.

“Careful.” said Fourteen, tapping the jug. “Or you’ll have none for later.”

“Well, I’m thirsty now.” he said, between sips. 

Fourteen shrugged.

Twenty Nine wiped his mouth with a sleeve. “So what happens next?”
“You are free to do as you like, until dark.”

Twenty Nine paused to think as his mind scoured his rejuvenating vocabulary. “Is that a curfew?”

“You know the word!” Fourteen smiled, exposing her powerful white teeth to the evening air. “That’s right, a curfew. You’ll sleep in my tent tonight. I’ll have a cot ready.”

Twenty Nine nodded. “When do I get my own tent?”

“When you are no longer newborn.” Fourteen turned to go. “There are a few hours of light left,” she said over her shoulder. “Use them well!” and left Twenty Nine alone at the edge of the village.

It was the first time Twenty Nine had been by himself since waking, and he was surprised by a sudden feeling of loneliness. The feeling was exacerbated by the sense that he was an alien to this world, and he pondered how he might mould to fit its strange shape.

Along the edge of the settlement stood a small rockwall about two feet high, constructed of bricks of soft sandstone. A young man sat atop the wall a few meters away, munching on a meat plant as he stared into space.

“Hey there,” said Twenty Nine, approaching the stranger from behind. “Mind if I join you?”

The young man snapped his head around, and let out a sigh of relief. “Oh, newborn. You should make more noise when you walk.” He gestured to the wall. “Sure, why not. It’s a free wall, far as I know.”

“Thanks.” Twenty Nine sat next to the young man.

“Don’t mention it. I’m Two Thirty Three. Friends call me Tee Three for short.”

“Twenty Nine.”

Tee Three nodded in recognition.

“So how long you been awake for, Tee Three?”

“About a year and a half, earth time, I think.” Seeing a look of confusion in Twenty Nine’s face, he continued. “We have clocks from the ship that can keep track. Otherwise it’d be hard to tell, out here.”

“Is earth time standard here?”

“We use it, yeah. Mostly cause there are no seasons, so it doesn’t matter. Don’t ask me how long an Osiris year is. All I know is that it’s a lot longer than earth’s.”

“Huh, interesting. No seasons?”

“Yeah.” Two Thirty Three paused to spit out a seed from his meat plant. “Heard something about a perfect rotational axis. Not sure though.”

“I guess that’s another question for Zero, then.”

“Yeah.” Two Thirty Three shifted in his seat and grew quiet. 

Twenty Nine grew restless in the silence and averted his gaze to scan the colony, searching for something to occupy his view. His eyes fell near a cluster of tents, where a woman sat in a man’s lap, kissing him in a passionate embrace. Soon, a second man approached the two and spoke. Twenty Nine could not hear what was said, but the woman stood and kissed him as well. She then grabbed both men’s hands, and with a coy smile, led them into her tent.

“Well.” said Twenty Nine, shaking his head in confusion. “Hey, Tee Three, is that normal here?” He pointed toward the tent that the people had just entered.

“What, sex?” Two Thirty Three finished his meat plant and threw its leafy stalk over the wall. “Sure it is. What else are people gonna do?”

“I mean, with multiple people like that.”

The young man smirked. “Course, why wouldn’t it be? Threesomes, foursomes, pairs—whatever happens, happens.”

“No one gets jealous?” A concept emerged from the recesses of Twenty Nine’s mind. “What about people in relationships?”

Two Thirty Three stared at the newcomer with a furrowed brow, incredulous. “To possess another? It’s taboo. You can’t do that.” He shook his head and looked away.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend. Just trying to figure things out.” Twenty Nine cleared his throat. “Maybe you could tell me more about it.”

“It’s simple. All belong to the colony. One is all. You own nothing. I own nothing.”

“So relationships?”

“Not allowed. Zero is clear: attachment leads to suffering.” Two Thirty Three cut his hand through the air in a gesture of finality.

“I see. But there’s lots of sex, still?”

“Course—people can’t get pregnant anyhow. And like I said, what else are they gonna do?”

Twenty Nine shrugged. “I guess having lots of sex is nice.”

“Lots of it? Oh no.” Two Thirty Three leaned forward, his eyes alight. “Casual yes, but not lots of it—not for everyone. Dunno if you’ve noticed, but there aren’t many women around here.”

Twenty Nine pulled his head back in surprise. “Huh, I guess that’s true, now that you mention it.”

“There are nearly two men for every woman. Odds are bad. It’s a competitive market.”

“I see. Even with all the sharing?”

“Even then,” Two Thirty Three nodded. “Every time a newborn is announced, we’re all praying for a woman, and it’s always a damned guy.” Two Thirty Three shot Twenty Nine a frustrated stare.

“Sorry, friend.” Twenty Nine showed his palms in a gesture of submission. “If I had a choice, I would have slept in.”

“I know, it’s not your fault.” 

Twenty Nine uncorked his jug for a sip of water, only to find it empty. “Damn,” he said. “Guess Fourteen was right.”

“Here, have some of mine,” Two Thirty Three handed over his canteen. “I’ve got a lot left.”

“Thanks!” said Twenty Nine. He took a sip and passed the canteen back. “Appreciate it.”

“Course,” said Two Thirty Three.

The conversation lulled into silence once more, and Twenty Nine began to fidget in order to fill the void. He found a long, thin rock on the ground and discovered that he could use it to carve lines into the soft sandstone bricks he was sitting on. He smiled to himself at the familiarity of it, and began drawing concentric circles into the wall.

“Hey, what are you doing?” said Two Thirty Three, his voice rising in panic.

“I was just drawing, see?” Twenty Nine stood to give the young man a clear view of his work.

“You can’t do that, it’s taboo!” Tee Three picked up a rock and began buffing out the patterns. “You want to get us in trouble?”

“I don’t understand, what did I do?”

“This!” said Tee three, pointing to the half erased drawing.

“Drew circles?”

“Yes!” Two Thirty Three finished buffing out the circles and rubbed his eyes. “Look, I think we should go our separate ways.”

“I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. What did I do wrong?”

Two Thirty three held up a palm, indicating silence. “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t tell the others that we shared water.”

“What?” Twenty Nine held up his hands, bewildered. “Alright, sure. If you could just explain...”

“Ask someone else.” said Tee three, waving as he walked away. “I’m bad at explaining things, anyway.”

Twenty Nine sat in the dark of the newly formed night, stunned into confusion. “I guess I’ve walked off another cliff.” he said to himself, shaking his head. He’d have questions for Fourteen, in the morning.
