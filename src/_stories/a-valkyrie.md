“Counting my wrinkles, are you?” said Etta, her voice resonating with those thick layers of musical expressiveness as she lay next to me, eyes closed.

“Of course not,” I said, giving a wink. “Only appreciating them.” I pulled my fingers away from the faint lines that creased her brow, and moved them into the thick and curly hair that bloomed down her back like a mane.

“Mmm” she let out a gentle moan from deep in her chest that vibrated like a cello, infusing my body with a slight rattle. “That’s good.” she said sleepily.

I leaned over to place my nose at her hairline and breathed in deeply, puckering my lips into a kiss as I hooked my leg between hers and tangled myself up in her long, lithe body.

She was beautiful in an imposing way, like towering evergreens draped in the thick snow of a dark northern winter. I imagine her ancestors would have been great warrior women — forces of nature like those evergreens — with angular and intense faces, just like hers; faces that could love and kill with equal passion. Baltic valkyries and noble lionesses.

But Etta wore her power with a painful self awareness. I can still remember our first few interactions, when the fear was stronger, and more intoxicating. She presented herself with a careful meekness: slightly bowed at the waist, clasping hands, and avoiding eye contact, as though such gestures could camouflage the intensity of her being. They couldn’t, of course; nothing could do that — but they did move me to pity, which I suppose opened me up to her, in a roundabout way…

“What are you thinking about?” she said, as I stared at the ceiling intently. She asked me this frequently, as though at any moment I might come to my senses and flee her.

“I was thinking about your painting over there.” I said, pointing at the easel in the corner. Half-finished, the canvas portrayed a giant, beaten man, who was tied to a skyscraper and screaming in defiant misery. The tortured man seemed part Jesus and part Atlas — dying for our sins in one way, yet also suffering from a much more personal disagreement with his creator. It was beautifully painted, as all her works were, with a dark and moody color pallet and exquisite classical details.

“What of it?” she said, with an edge in her voice.

“I just notice a theme with your paintings, is all.” I said, carefully. “Lots of suffering…” I was still afraid of her, and wasn’t sure of what those eyes told me she was capable of, so I danced around the issue.

“And?”

“And why?” I said, pausing to feel it out. “Do you feel you suffer like that?”

“Hmph.” said Etta, turning away from me sulkily. “Why does it matter? It’s just a painting.”

“It’s got to reflect something in you, Etta.” I said.

“Oh what of it? What if I suffer like that, hm?” she said, sitting up in bed. “Does that make me undesirable?” Her voluminous hair frizzled about her head like an eccentric picture frame.

“Whoa,” I said, taken aback by her sudden defensiveness. This is the story those eyes are telling. I thought to myself. “Relax, I’m not accusing you of anything. I’m just trying to understand.”

“Understand what?” she said, tears already forming in the corners of her eyes. “Oh god, I knew this was coming.”

“What?” I said. “Nothing is coming.” But at this rate, it absolutely was.

“Just get it over with!” she said, hiding her eyes behind her hand. “Why draw it out.”

“Because I want to understand you. This isn’t what you seem to think it is.”

“Ok, understand me, then. Tell me what bothers you, quickly.” Her voice, resonant with a warrior’s ferocity, cut through the air.

“Ok,” I said, my heart skipping in my chest. “Frankly, I worry about your… mental state.” I knew, the minute the words left me, that they were the wrong ones to choose.

“Oh, so I’m crazy, now? After you fucked me?” Etta let those dark eyes shoot daggers through me. “That’s convenient, isn’t it?”

“No, no, not like that.” I said, but it was like that. “I was just worried about, well, this sort of thing.”

“What’s this?” she sneered, clutching her pillow in a balled fist.

“Well, look at how you’re handling this conversation.” I said. “This is the sort of thing I’m worried about.”

“Being offended by an asshole? That’s what worries you? Ironic!”

“No, erratic emotional responses like this.” I said.

“There is nothing erratic about this!”

“Maybe I should just go.” I said, seeing no easy way out of the conversation.

“No, you stay.” she said, grabbing me roughly by the arm. “Explain yourself.”

“I don’t need to explain anything to you.” I said. “I would like to leave now.” My heart was in my throat, and it threatened to strangle me.

“Too bad. You’re staying until I’m satisfied.” she said, resolutely with a furrowed brow and gaunt, tear-streaked cheeks.

My heart hammered in it’s chest. “How will you be satisfied?”

“I want you to face me and be honest!” she said. “Tell me why you want to leave.”

I sighed, and gathered my courage. honesty may be the best recourse. I thought. “I didn’t want to leave until you started acting like this. And now I want to leave because I am afraid of you.”

Etta rocked back as if she’d been physically struck, her face went slack, and she nodded slowly. “There it is.” she said, as a well of tears poured down her face. She looked up at the ceiling as if in desperate prayer. “There it is… why do you fear me?”

“Because” I said, pausing to think, I stood near the door to her bedroom now, and had put some of my clothes back on. “I see so much pain and loneliness in you, and I don’t know where it ends.”

“But that is mine, not yours!”

“You know better than that.” I said, shaking my head. “That’s why you got so defensive; this has happened before, hasn’t it?”

“Shut up!” said Etta, throwing her pillow at me in a vicious motion. “You have no right to speak to me about MY past!”

“Ok, fair enough.” I said, raising my hands in a calming motion. I would have dashed for the door right there, but I wanted to end this cleanly. “fair enough.” I rubbed my brow as I considered what to say. “I worry that your suffering is this deep, empty well that I will never fill, do you understand?”

“I don’t need you to fill it!”

“You may not, but if we become close, I will have to share it with you. I don’t know if I am cut out for that.”

“Ridiculous!” said Etta, almost spitting the words. “You’re nuts!”

“You know it’s true.” I said. “I’m sorry, but I can’t handle that.”

“Then why the FUCK did you come here tonight?” she said, her pupils constricting as she barked. Her hair almost seemed to stand up on end as she became angrier, lending a dramatic flair to her temper. But I saw then what I needed to say.

“Because I had hoped the conversation would go better than this, and that you could convince me otherwise.” I said flatly.

A hollow look suddenly occupied her face as she hunched down and stared at the floor. “Oh god” she said. “oh god.”

I wanted to comfort her, to smell her hair and kiss her forehead, to tell her everything would be okay; I still loved her, after all. But I knew that would only make it worse, now. “Goodbye, Etta.” I said, heading for the door.

“Oh god.” she moaned loudly. “Can we just talk about this?”

“We already have.” I said over my shoulder.
