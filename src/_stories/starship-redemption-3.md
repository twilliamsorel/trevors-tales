“Put these on,” said Fourteen as she threw Twenty Nine a tunic and cargo pants. The pair stood in her tent, a single room constructed of canvas walls that stretched around rough metal spines.

“What was that, back there?” said Twenty Nine, fumbling with the clothes as he spoke. “Why is everyone bald?”

Fourteen sighed. “One question at a time, newborn.”

“What was that back there?”

“That was The Voice, delivering the latest sheep into his flock,” she said, crossing her arms as she leaned against the wall of her hut, watching Twenty Nine with restless eyes.

“Who? You mean Forty Seven?”

“I do. He is more than he seems.” Fourteen turned away, and began rummaging in a large chest in the corner of the room, removing various tools and placing them on her belt. 

“Is he the leader of the colony?”

Fourteen smirked. “He is The Voice of Zero. Zero leads the colony, technically.”

“So he isn’t the leader.”

“Technically not. But Zero is never here.”

“Why not?” said Twenty Nine.

“He stays on the ship. Forty Seven is Zero’s voice, eyes, and ears. So who leads? You tell me.”

“I see. Why doesn’t Zero leave the ship?”

Fourteen snorted a short laugh. “You’ll learn, when the time comes.”

“When will that be?”

“When you’re ready. When you’re in balance, and you understand our ways.” Fourteen slung a bag over her shoulder. “No more questions, for now. Follow.”

Along one of the walls of canvas there was a gap, covered by a heavy cloth drop that acted as a door. Fourteen pulled the drop aside and stepped outside, beckoning for Twenty Nine to follow.

He obliged and stepped into the heat of the midday suns. It was a dry heat, one felt strongly on the skin, but not heavily in the nostrils. Twenty Nine was grateful for this, and breathed the air in deep with relief as he shaded his eyes with a hand.

He had stepped into the center of the colony, a thick concentration of buildings similar to Fourteen’s&mdash;canvas tents sheltered by sheets of scrap metal overhead. Around these buildings, colonists went about their various tasks with a familiar ease, smiling and chatting with one-another as they worked. Few took notice of Twenty Nine as he followed Fourteen through the settlement, besides to deliver an occasional grin or wave. Twenty Nine watched the people as he passed, his confusion mounting as an uneasy feeling grew inside him.

“What is it, newborn?” said Fourteen, watching him over her shoulder. “You aren’t asking any questions.”

“I don’t know yet,” he said. His brain was full of empty shelves, and try as he might, he couldn’t connect the concepts to voice the source of his discomfort. “There’s something wrong with this place.”

“Never a good feeling to have,” said Fourteen, smirking. “Not knowing why you worry.”

Twenty Nine watched an old man hobble out from a hut and dip his leathery hands in a small bucket of water. He looked up and gave a toothless smile as the pair passed. “Newborn,” he said.

Twenty Nine studied the old man with bewildered eyes as the thought came to him. “There are no children,” he said, his brow creased.

“True. We’re all sterile, so there are no children.”

Twenty Nine stopped in his tracks, struggling as his weak model of existence failed to map to his new reality. “But why? Is there no cure? How will your people survive?”

Fourteen smiled. “That’s more like it, newborn. You’re back in form.” She paused a moment to take a sip of water from her canteen before continuing. “We don’t know why we’re sterile&mdash;some speculate that it’s a side effect of being in stasis for too long, but none are sure. As for how we survive: others wake, like yourself. Newborns like you keep the population going.”

“How long has it been since that ship crashed? They can’t last forever.”

“I’ve been awake for three years, and have seen seven other newborns. The oldest among us has been awake for thirty years. Apparently there’s an ample supply.”

Twenty Nine shook his head and rubbed his temples. “None of this makes sense.”

“You’re still newborn, with your full head of hair. Give it time. Think too hard, with too little information, and you’ll tie your brain in knots.”

Twenty Nine nodded. “Sound advice.”

The pair neared the center of the settlement, where the moisture condensers loomed over the huts like sculptures from a bygone era. A tenant stood near the cisterns at the base of the machines, exchanging tokens with colonists, who then proceeded to collect water. 

“That is the custodian, He regulates the water supply.” Fourteen held up a metal token, imprinted with a moon. “There are two tokens, one with a star, and one with a moon. If one day is a star day, then the other is a moon day, understand?”

Twenty Nine shook his head.

“You have to exchange your token. It will be easier if I just show you.”

The pair approached the custodian, an olive skinned man of medium build, with astute eyes and an upright posture.

“Eighty Nine,” said Fourteen, nodding at the custodian in recognition.

“Fourteen,” he said, examining the token. “It is indeed a moon day.” He placed the token in one of two large pouches at his waist, and handed her a star token from the other one. “And you’ve brought a first timer, I see.”

“Yes. The newborn needs his first token, and a jug.”

“Certainly.” Eighty Nine reached behind one of the cisterns and produced a clear glass jug, which he handed to Twenty Nine. “Fill that up, and I’ll give you your token.” he said, studying Twenty Nine’s bewildered expression. “You understand its function? You only get one jug a day.”

“I understand.” Twenty Nine went to the nearest cistern, filled his container, and then waited on Fourteen as she did the same.

“How goes your first day?” said Eighty Nine, weighing the newcomer with a glance. “Is the colony to your liking?”

Twenty Nine shook his head. “I don’t know yet. It’s a strange place.” 

“How so?”

“Well, you’re all bald and sterile, for starters.”

“Ah yes, well you get used to the lack of hair. It’s a choice, technically. That other issue is a bit more difficult, but has its advantages.” Eighty Nine’s eyes drifted to some unseen point in the distance, and smiled.

“What sort of advantage?” said Twenty Nine. 

“In a word, freedom. Children are a great responsibility, you know.”

“You don’t seem worried about the future.”

Eighty Nine shrugged. “I’ll likely be dead before it’s a problem.”

“I guess that’s looking on the bright side.”

The custodian snorted. “I don’t look forward to my death. There’s nothing bright about it.”

“And here I had you pinned for an optimist.”

Eighty Nine arched an eyebrow. “Big words for a newborn. But no, you have me wrong. I’m a pessimist, through and through. It’s my levity that has you fooled.”

“You, on me!” Fourteen jabbed her finger at Twenty Nine, and beckoned him to follow. “We’re off to harvest the meat plant.”

“Looks like I’m off then,” said Twenty Nine, nodding to the custodian.

Eighty Nine waved. “Walk in the light.”

The meat farm sat on the western edge of the colony, a sprawling field fed by an irrigation system of rusty old pipes. The pipes ran across the field from end to end, hovering over the crops like dispassionate metal rain clouds, and dividing them into tight rows. Between these rows were the meat plants, entrenched in the ground with deep roots that were efficient at extracting moisture from the desert soil. The plants looked like fleshy beets, flowering from large green pods that sat close to the earth. 

Twenty Nine followed Fourteen down one such row of meat plants, mixing the soil with a rake so that it would better absorb the fertilizer she sprinkled over the ground.

“See, for all your complaining, it’s not so bad,” said Fourteen, continuing with her work as she spoke.

“Speak for yourself. I'm sweaty, and that dirt you're sprinkling reeks."

"It's lizard dung." She grew a fistful of the guano on the ground behind her. "Of course it stinks."

"Lizards here? Seems unlikely."

Fourteen nodded. "They look like lizards, anyway. So that's what we call them."

Twenty Nine watched the ground by his feat. "Are they dangerous?"

"Only if you let one bite you."

"Great. Poisonous alien lizards, back-breaking labor; what else have you got in store?” 

Fourteen smiled at her toes. “It’s an agrarian life on Osiris Six.”

“Your sarcasm reeks of honesty,” said Twenty Nine, pausing to wipe sweat from his brow. “A nasty habit. I prefer my sarcasm nice and pure.”

“Day one and you already have preferences? I’m impressed. Your personality is coming through quickly.”

“I re-remember fast.”

Fourteen paused from spreading fertilizer. “So it would seem. Alright, what’s an example of pure sarcasm?”

Twenty Nine cleared his throat and stood tall. “I tell you, manual labor is twice as fun under two suns.” He gave a pitiful smile and awaited a response.

Fourteen remained expressionless. “Weak,” she said, and turned back to her work.

“Not bad for being out of that tank for only a few hours.”

“That may be true,” said Fourteen.

There was a long moment of silence, the only noises coming from a light wind and the crunching of shoes on the soil. The quiet made Twenty Nine restless, gave too much room for nervous questions to boil over in his brain. 

“So what’s with these meat plants?” he said. “Odd name for a vegetable.”

“They’re genetically engineered to provide the same nutritional value as beef, and then some,” said Fourteen. “They’re a staple food here.”

“I’m guessing they aren’t native.”

“No, they were on the ship&mdash;engineered on earth.”

“How do they taste?” said Twenty Nine, poking one with a finger. 

“Like steak and beets had a lovechild.”

“Sounds appetizing. Can’t wait to try it.”

“Oh, you’ll try it. And try it. And Try it, until you’re sick of the stuff,” said Fourteen.

“Not much variety on Osiris Six, then?”

“Not around here, no.”

Twenty Nine paused a moment, considering his words, and then blurted them out all the same. “Do you ever get bored here? It all just seems so small&mdash;farming, sleeping, farming, sleeping.”

“Bored compared to what?” Fourteen flashed Twenty Nine a startled glance. “Do you remember something?”

“Not a memory. Just a feeling, like there’s more out there, or could be.”

Fourteen relaxed a bit, and nodded. “I’m familiar with such feelings.” She went back to spilling fertilizer. “I do not get bored, no. The work here keeps me busy, and I have no other life to compare it to.”

Twenty Nine nodded. “And everyone else?”

“None of us know any different. We share this life, and have nothing to compare to.”

“Besides Zero.”

Fourteen was silent for a moment, a slight tension visible in the curve of her neck. “Yes, besides Zero.”

“Does Zero remember who we are?”

“Who we were? Some of it&mdash;a very small amount. Most of us had files on the ship.”

“Who were you?”

Fourteen stopped working, and stood erect, the muscles in her back tensing. There was a long pause before she spoke. “You are newborn, so you could not know. But you must never ask that question. It is taboo.”

“Taboo? But&mdash;”

“That’s enough!” Fourteen cut her hand through the air. “We will not discuss this any longer. I am Fourteen, now. It’s easier that way.” She returned to her work, spilling fertilizer with angry thrusts.

Twenty Nine bowed his head, and raked in silence. He did not understand the rules of this place, did not understand why his questions never seemed to be answered. He felt as though he was walking along a cliff face blindfolded, and at any moment he might make a wrong turn and tumble to his death. It left him feeling more lost than ever; powerless and uncomfortable.

The work on that row of plants seemed to last an eternity.
