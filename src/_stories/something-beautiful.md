She’s got the face of a dowager, with pursed lips that sit at the edge of her profile like a thick teardrop as she stares at the field—a sprawling knot of gourds and vines, set beneath a long knoll that sprouts a tree line of pumpkin colored foliage. 

“Fall’s my favorite season,” she says, leaning over her coffee. “There’s magic to it.”

“Is it the colors?” He asks, dark eyes trained on her slender form, as though he’s scared she might bolt away at any moment.

“Not just the colors.” She rests her head on his shoulder, long neck pushing the bun of her hair over his mouth, and a fuzzy fog bank rolls over the young man’s mind. 

He cups her hands in his, encasing the latte in an extra layer of goosebumps. “Yeah? What else then?”

“It’s like nature is painting with a brush, you know? And everybody’s joining in, playing with their imaginations. Carved faces, flannel scarecrows; that kind of thing.”

“Hm.”

“Know what I mean?” She turns to glance at his profile, and waits. 

But he only knows the feeling of her bun on his cheek, and the pitter patter of his heart, drumming at his chest like a runaway piston. “Yea.”

She lets out a sigh and kicks at crinkled leaves, causing the frills of her white dress to billow—a fluttering curtain in the cool afternoon air. It sends ripples of a restless ennui up her longs legs, and sinking into her core. Maybe it’s hopeless, she thinks, and he’ll never kiss me. 

She pulls the band from her hair to release the bun into a cascade of brunette locks, and leans away. A blush of indignation colors her cheeks.

He watches as her posture shrinks, shoulder thrust as a stony wedge between them, and his heartbeat falters. He reaches out a languid arm, begging to bridge the gap once more, but she swats the hand and turns away.

“What’s wrong?” he says.

“Nothing is wrong.” She can’t tell him, of course. That would ruin everything. 

“I really do like the trees.”

Her laughter is a burst of sharp air. “Great. Good for you.”

“What? I’m just saying I agree with you! I like the trees too.”

“What’s that got to do with anything?”

“You were talking about nature being a painting!”

“Don’t raise your voice.” The young woman stiffens her back and stares at the tree line, away from the man. The moment’s as cold as the October wind that engulfs them; chilly touches that promise a frosty dew in the morning.

They sit in silence as the man replays the moment in his head. She watches from the corner of her eye, observing the concentration on his face. It stirs a mote of warmth in her chest, and she turns away once more to conceal a smile. Still, he catches the playful shake of her shoulders. 

“Are you messing with me?” 

“No, never.”

“That’s really not funny.”

“I’m really not.” She’s in hysterics now, rib cage shaking as she collapses into a pile on the bench, giddiness distilled by an absurd romantic pressure. 

“You’re messed up,” says the man, though a smile gently curves the edges of his lips also.

She can only shake her head in response. She takes a deep breath and wipes a tear from the corner of her eyelash. “You’re ridiculous.”

“I still don’t see how, though.”

“Maybe you never will. Wouldn’t be surprising.” She stands and does a little pirouette that twists her skirt like a bottle cap. “Shall we walk?”

“Sure, why not.”

The young man stands to join the woman and they walk toward the woods, shoulders occasionally brushing, magnetized by the gravity of unspoken feelings. The feelings polarize the flesh, creating sparks and tingles that steal at the breath, so that the couple barely notices passing through the tree line. It engulfs them in the cool shadow of bark and willow wisps—darting threads of dark cast by falling leaves that weave to the ground in a diffused wind. The padded forest floor mutes their steps, like powdery snow in the dead of winter. 

“We’ll never work out, you know,” she says, smirking to signal a bent for banter. But the young man is too earnest in his quest, and already suspects a flightiness in her affection. His face grows ashen as he stares at the kaleidoscopic foliage that litters the forest floor.

“Why do you say that?”

She shrugs. “Something in the air, I guess.”

A bitterness rises in him, like bile up the nervous system, saturating his thoughts and dragging them into angry recesses of his mind. His memories of rejection spill forth, creating a narrative of self righteous indignation that he directs at the entire quixotic species of womanhood. 

“Women are so fickle,” he says, words thick as they play at the drama of finality. It’s a shift in tone, one that rattles his companion, who creates a shred of distance as he speaks. “One day I’ll be rich and powerful.” His stride increases with the ambition of the thought, imperious legs swinging over the vague path in the woods like eager pendulums, driving more space between them.

The woman struggles to keep pace, breath coming more quickly now. “That’ll only make you miserable, you know—being rich for richness’ sake.”

He stops abruptly, spinning on a heel to gaze into her eyes. His are a flaming cacophony of potent thoughts. “Everyone will want to be me. Then you’ll see.”

She stands frozen, and wants to tell him that she was only joking, only trying to rile him up. But now that he’s been riled she finds the feelings are too real, and it doesn’t feel so silly anymore. Those bright eyes, so alight with the fire of a thousand passions are terrible in their bitter anger.

“That’s very unattractive.”

“What is?”

“Are you really so sorry for yourself? A real man would be unfazed.”  

The young man’s face goes red and he spins in a circle, clenching his fists as though he might explode. “Is that what you want? Some unfeeling idiot, who grunts commands and keeps you like livestock?”

“I never said that.”

“That’s what it sounded like. Unfazed—might as well not care at all.”

“That’s it, then? You’re all sorry for yourself because you care? If you cared—”

“It’s because I can’t have you! Is that so hard to understand?”

The words carry across the muted landscape, carrying a ripple of a deeper silence in their wake. The trees seem to go still, as though they’ve perked up ears to listen.

The young woman stares at her feet, face hot as her mind replays the words. He really does love me, she thinks, and reaches out to touch him. “Why can’t you have me?”

“You tell me.” The young man shakes his head, bitterness simmering down to a tired frustration. “It a cruel game of push and pull. I can’t figure it out.”

Despite her best efforts, a smile touches her lashes, and seems to only grow brighter the more she tries to suppress it. The poor, oblivious boy. “I’m sorry,” she says. “Don’t be mad.”

Her doughy gaze and soft touch cool the lingering heat inside the man, and the moment is transformed by the alchemy of romance—fires of anger redirected to fuel fluttering hearts, as the young man stares at her autumn lips, and every other thought is flushed from his head.

“Forget the money,” she says, never breaking her gaze. “I’d rather have a cottage by the ocean.”

“Yeah?” The man’s mind is mush as he leans toward her. “Those can be pricey.”

“Not away from the cities.” She is leaning too, tucking her head into his chest to feel the warm tenor of his voice vibrate against her cheek.

“And what would I do for a living?” He smiles as her hair brushes his mouth, and angles down to lay a peck on her brow line. 

She pulls her chin from his chest and looks up to meet his gaze, wrapping an arm around his neck, locking it in place. “All sorts of things. For an adventurous life, you could be a fisherman, or work at a bookstore in the country.”

“Not much money in that,” he says, drawing ever closer.

“You don’t need money, silly! Just courage.”

“Courage for what?”

“For a kiss.”

Their lips lock, sending a compound of opiates shooting through their bodies; limbs weak, skin flushed and rosy&mdash;beings already intermingled in the heat of gentle pressure. Their torsos merge in the wake of butterflies, chests blend in the feeling of the others heartbeat. She rakes her hand through his hair and he feels that his whole form is consumed inside of hers. Formless and never alone. Formless in the silence of fallen trees, beneath a steeple of ashen bark and pillars of twisting boughs.

A cottage by the ocean&mdash;made of stone and driftwood, with little children playing in the tide as flavored smoke ushers from the chimney. The days would be counted by the brilliance of sunsets, which would play across the ripples of the water in shades of magenta and pale orange. Lavender sunsets, and the tickle of sand between bare toes, passing one after the other with each footstep like the hands of a clock, until the smell of salt is always present in her wavy hair, and his face is wrinkled from long pauses, made to watch masts as they disappear over the edge of world.
