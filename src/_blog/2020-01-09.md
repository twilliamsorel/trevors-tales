Hello again,
<br><br>
It's been nearly a week since my last post, and I figure you're overdue for an update. First, on Morgan the Magician: I am writing the first act from scratch, a short story about a shady magician for hire. My intention is to make this a series and publish more acts over time. However, the problem is, completing this story is taking some time. This brings me to my next point...
<br><br>
I need some new damned content! To that end I've decided to release another story I've been working on (a novel, actually) chapter-by-chapter, to provide some new reading material. So I'll have two projects ongoing, simultaneously&mdash;Morgan the Magician short stories and this serialized novel, called The Crash of the Starship Discovery.
<br><br>
So, I'll be releasing the <a href="/stories/starship-discovery-1">first chapter of The Crash of the Starship Discovery</a> today, and plan on releasing more chapters in the coming weeks. It's a science fiction story, set in the distant future, when a colony ship has crashlanded on an unknown world.
<br><br>
Talk soon,<br>
Trevor
