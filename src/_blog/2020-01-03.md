Pardon the minor delay in my posting. It's been a busy holiday season. 
<br><br>
Seeing as I've promised new content, I wanted to give a quick update on Morgan the Magician, and where I decided to take it. 
<br><br>
Basically, I decided that the best move would be to write this as a series of short stories, each encapsulated, but each interconnected. This would allow me to shift the focus and themes to something more compelling (risk taking and it's relationship to freedom, overcoming adversity, desperation, etc). To that end, seeing as I'm starting with fresh material, my frequency might slow down a bit. I'm still hoping to bring you weekly content, but may require some flexibility as the stories are being written to my standards. 
<br><br>
The good news is that I've already got the first few story ideas planned, so progress has been made! The first story will Feature Morgan, a black market illusionist of ill repute, as he takes on a shady task for a morally flexible politician: framing his opponent for blackmail.

Talk soon,<br>
