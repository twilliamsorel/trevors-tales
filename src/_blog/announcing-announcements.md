After a little over a year, I've finally realized that I need a way of communicating to my (theoretical) audience beyond just posting stories. So, I've added this "Updates and Announcements" section to my site. It's basically a blog where I can interact with you, the reader, through a means that doesn't involve a structured narrative. My hope is to add some context to my writing, as well as updates on what's going on in my world, where relevant. I may even splurge by adding some opinions here or there as the mood strikes (though I'll be cautious).
<br><br>
In any case, to accomodate the new blog and renewed activity, I've made a few additional changes to the site. I've re-added a mailing list, which you can subscribe to <a href="/mailing-list">here</a>, as well as moved the stories from the homepage to a new page altogether. I've also added an RSS feed to my blog and story sections, and am in the process of revamping my homepage to better enable this new flow of content.
<br><br>
In the coming days I'll be revamping the homepage, making another announcement, and releasing new content for your enjoyment. So stick around, <a href="/mailing-list">subscribe to my mailing list</a>, and <a href="/contact">give me some feedback</a> if the mood strikes.
<br><br>
Regards,<br>
