Hello.
<br><br>
This online storytelling business is a new journey for me, and I'm learning things every day. That's great, but it also means I'm iterating a lot in order to figure things out. I recently made lots of improvements to the website, including adding an updates section (blog), as well as made some announcements for projects. I'm already changing tack on these things a bit, but it's all for the better.
<br><br>
Basically, what I've realized is that I should be treating my blog as quality content, in the same way I treat my stories. I should not be using it, as I have been, for superfluous updates regarding my goings-on (this is my last blog post in that vein, just to pivot; I'm be deleting all my other status-update blogs). There are a few reasons for this: for one thing, as an update machine, the blog is just wasted real estate&mdash;useless noise in the void when it could be so much more. But that part is obvious. The real nasty bit about status updates is that they violate the volatile nature of the artiste: I keep commiting to things only to go back on my word in another status update a few days later. This will not do. 
<br><br>
A creative writer (I think) must have the freedom to explore and be flexible; to embark on whatever path they must to figure out the road they are to travel. This is especially true in the early stages. So, I'll be announcing no more commitments and time tables to violate. That is not to say that I don't strive to publish consistent, quality content&mdash;I do, but I'll keep the noise to a minimum, and not broadcast my indecisive thought process (which isn't very tied to outcomes anyway).
<br><br>
So, moving forward, I'll publish blog topics on the blog, and stories in the story section. There will be no more daily commitments and updates here... unless a situation really warrants it. Stories will continue to be stories; so look out for them. That's really all there is to it. 
<br><br>
Now, a question for my audience: what do you expect to see, or hope to see, in a creative writer's blog? 
<br><br>
Talk soon,<br>
