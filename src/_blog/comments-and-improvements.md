Another day, another update.
<br><br>
As promised, I've gone ahead and added a commenting feature to my stories by way of Disqus (an integrated chat application). I've placed the comment box at the very bottom of each of my story pages, but you can get to it quickly by clicking the chat bubble icon (<i class="fas fa-comment"></i>) in the story submenu. Use this new feature to provide me with some feedback, or just to comment as you feel... or don't use it at all&mdash;see what I care.
<br><br>
I've also made some minor tweaks to the site in order to improve legibility, which was an issue that some readers pointed out to me. To address this, I've reduced the font sizes a bit, and reduced the contrast between the font colors and backgrounds for a (hopefully) easier read. 
<br><br>
Finally, the other big change for the day is bittersweet but necessary. I've decided that I need to be more focused in my approach to this site, and not so scattershot with my writing. To this end, I'll be focusing on fantasy and science fiction, and am removing most of my old stories which don't fit those genres. I will be leaving a few stories which don't fit the bill for now, but only because to remove them would be to remove ALL of the writing on my site, which would leave nothing... which is also bad. But as I create more speculative fiction stories I'll be phasing those few remainders out as well. Please bear with me. 
<br><br>
On that note, I'll get to work on rewriting that first chapter of Morgan the Magician for you. It's a comedic fantasy that follows the exploits of a morally questionable wizard as he struggles to survive in the criminal underworld of Almsborough. So stay tuned. I'm already thinking I may make this a series of standalone stories, instead of a long novel, which would also be cool...
<br><br>
Talk soon,<br>
